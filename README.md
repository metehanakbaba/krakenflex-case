> This case is demonstrate my engineering skills. 

## Purpose
- Retrieves all outages from the `GET /outages` endpoint 
- Retrieves information from the `GET /site-info/{siteId}` endpoint for the site with the ID `norwich-pear-tree`
- Filters out any outages that began before `2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z` or don't have an ID that is in the list of
   devices in the site information 
- For the remaining outages, it should attach the display name of the device in the site information to each appropriate outage
- Sends this list of outages to `POST /site-outages/{siteId}` for the site with the ID `norwich-pear-tree`
- Handler has been created and errors that may occur due to http will be handled and the result will be handle.
- Architecturally developed a completely modular system
- Developed a unit test that makes sure the entire system is working well
- A new instance has been created for `axios`
- The interceptor has been developed so that the specific baseurl and headers are in new `axios` instance
- Developed according to the `SOLID` principle
- Directory schema set up at `app level` and `service level`
- Initialized `.env`
- `Prettier:` A formatter for our code, which helps us to follow a certain code style.
- `ts-node:` Is a TypeScript execution engine for Node.js, it JIT (just in time) transforms TypeScript code to JavaScript allowing us to use TypeScript without pre-compiling our code and includes other bunch of useful features.
- `tsconfig-paths:` TypeScript accepts arbitrary paths in our tsconfig.json which can replace relative routes in our code, however if we try to run our files with node or ts-node, the modules won't be found, this package helps us to load those modules.
- `eslint-config-prettier:` Turns off all the unnecessary rules or the ones that might conflict with Prettier.
- `ESLint:` Is a utility who helps us to find and fix errors in our code. Due to the fact that JavaScript is a loosely-typed language there is more probability we introduce errors.

## NOTE:
`Actually, instead of functional programming, the case problem can be solved by oop and generating a single class instance.`
